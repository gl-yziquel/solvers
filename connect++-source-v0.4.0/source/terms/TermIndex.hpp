/**
* \brief Look after terms, (ideally) using hash consing to avoid 
*        storing copies of terms.
*
* Everything is implemented such that this ignores whether or not 
* Variables are substituted. (Because to do otherwise isn't 
* necessary.)
*
* At present this is the best of two worlds. Unfortunately, use of 
* unordered_map with Term and proper hash consing can result in 
* strange errors, on *some* compilers but not others, and 
* I'm not too sure where they come from, although there seems 
* to be a problem with memory allocation/deallocation. Using 
* the unordered_map means allowing various kinds of copying 
* of Terms, which I'd rather not do, and that may be the place 
* to look.s
* 
* Despite this, early indications are that it's definitely
* worth using the full-blown hash table. If you allow HASHCONSTERMS 
* to be defined in BasicTypes.hpp you will compile with full 
* hash consing. Otherwise you'll get the alternative.
*
* The alternative version has the same behaviour but is likely to be 
* a little less efficient. The fact that it works just fine
* on every compiler I've tried suggests that something very 
* obscure might be happening in the bowels of the hashed 
* version to make memory errors show up. TODO...
*
* You should *only* use this to make Terms. As long as you 
* do that then this class takes all the responsibility for 
* memory allocation and deallocation for Terms.
