/**
* \brief Prover using a pair of stacks to conduct the proof search.
*
* This version is a straightforward translation of the proof 
* method to search for a tree with all its leaves being axioms. 
* However, by not using recursion we retain the ability to fully 
* control backtracking and therefore, amongst other things, 
* find all possible proofs.
*
* This is really the main class for Connect++, and everything 
* else essentially exists to support it. There's a lot going 
* on here so hang on to your hat!
*
* This is also one of only a small number of places where you'll 
* need to modify stuff to incorporate machine learning. The main 
* advice is simple: take notice of the comments that point out where 
* to do this, and be *very* careful to leave the general 
* stack manipulation code alone unless you *really* know what 
* you're doing, because that stuff is quite easy to break.
