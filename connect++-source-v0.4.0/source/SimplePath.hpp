* \brief Simple representation of the path within a proof tree.
*
* While the Path class (not part of the source distribution) keeps a 
* separate vector of literals for each possible predicate/negation c
* ombination so it's fast to get the potential literals for
* reductions, this does not. The reason is that this one needs 
* to be copied to support full backtracking, and I haven't yet looked 
* at optimising to see what the trade-off is between finding reductions 
* fast, and making copies of the path_index.
*
* This class is also a natural location for any methods used to 
* find reductions, and a natural location for the test_for_regularity
* method.
