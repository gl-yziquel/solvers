* See the Wikipedia page. This is apparently due to Montelli and
* Montanari (1982). Looking at "An Efficient Unification Algorithm --
* yes, indeed it is. The algorithm as stated in the paper is
* nondeterministic, and apparently you get a bunch of different
* outcomes depending on the details of the implementation.
*
* So: this one uses a queue, taking something from the end and
* placing any results at the beginning. 
*
* Note that some modifications have to be made compared with the
* paper's presentation, because the method used to make 
* substitutions takes immediate effect. As a result, 
* substitutions get removed by the Delete rule, so you might 
* as well remove them immediately. Also, when substituting x=? 
* you don't need to check whether x appears in the other equations.
